//---------------------------Menus--------------------------
//This .dic file is primarily concerned with the double-click menus for each of your ghosts. If you don't want to have menus for your characters, you'd just have to delete the OnMouseDoubleClick functions near the end of mouse.dic and then ignore this file, as none of it will be called I believe. Menus can be cool though, since you can put stuff in them and create new functions if you know what you're doing. For example, I've added a lot of games and interactions and little linked icons to my Hunter Smoker ghost to keep track of their feelings and such. Much of that is pretty complicated though (and kind of messy, cough), so I won't go into it here, but I covered some of the concepts in the coding page of the walkthrough, and enterprising ghost makers can study the menu.dic file I set up for Hunter/Smoker and see how I put it together.
//Anyway, menu.dic also contains the settings for a config menu that will let your user change their name or pronouns if they want, as well as the talk rate of the ghost, all of which are useful things for your ghost to do. So think hard about whether or not you want to skip this file or not.

//The complexity of this file depends on how customized you want your menus. If you just want to leave them as they are, then all you'll have to do is replace dialogue appropriately. You can always add stuff to their menus later if you get the urge. Otherwise, if you have plans in mind, you'll need to study what's going on in here carefully and pay attention to how things are set up! You can do a lot of unique stuff in this file if you're creative.

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!


//--OpenSakuraMenu
//This is a bit of intro dialogue before the main character opens their menu. You can see below that there are three pieces of separate dialogue listed before it goes to MenuRun. The character will randomly choose one of those pieces of dialogue before opening the rest of their menu. You can customize this with individual greetings for the character, such as "Yes, %(username)?" or "Need something, %(username)?" or things like that. Note that none of the lines end with \e!
//The \b2 tag tells the ghost to use their big balloon for this dialogue. If your menu has a lot of stuff, this'll probably look better than the small one.
//If you don't want multiple responses before opening the menu, you can delete the dialogue and just leave MenuRun.

	  //These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost.

	  //I briefly touched in bootend.dic about \q, but I'll again cover it here. Pay very close attention to how this bit of dialogue is formatted. You'll see it goes \![*]\q[Displayed Name,linkedfunction]. Breaking it down, \![*] puts the balloon's option icon in front of the choice (usually a > or something), \q sets up the choice, Displayed Name which is the text that will display in the ghost's balloon, then linkedfunction, which is what the choice is linked to when the user clicks it. As you go through this file, look at how every menu option is set up, and you will see they all follow this format, give or take a \![*]. If you're going to be adding new options to menus or creating your own functions and such, make sure you follow this format and learn it well. Make sure to read the coding page of the walkthrough.

//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//Some of you may be wondering why some of these Select.options lead to another function. Why not just put the config menu coding under Select.configmenu, instead of linking to TalkConfig?
//Basically any function that's preceded with Select. is limited in its complexity and can only be called within its own .dic file in my experience. Why should you care, you ask? Well, if you're going to link to this function any other way, such as linking it in other .dic files or as a page in a menu, it needs to be a stand-alone function so it can be properly called. I'm pretty sure.
//The basic jist is this; if you're going to reuse whatever it is the option leads to, you should make it its own function. Otherwise, you can leave it in Select.option. As a rule of thumb I'd probably put any complicated stuff in its own function, then use the Select.option to call the full function as you can see above. Simple dialogue responses to a choice can stay as a Select.option though (Like "Do you like going to raves and partying? Yes/No"). Study what stays as a Select.option and what links to another Function as we go through the file.
